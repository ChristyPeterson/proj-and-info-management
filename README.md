# A place for project and information management documents and scripts

This repo is meant to house all my documentation and scripts for information and project management. I've been spending a decent amount of time thinking about collaborative computational biology, specifically how to set up project directories and keep lab journals. My goal is to create a project that is easily taken up by my colleagues and their ability to quickly ascertain the state of the project, where and why tools were run, and be able to replicate any part of the project as needed.

Its a work in progress, but this is where I've gotten to so far.
